# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**iAnchor** (`@vissong/ianchor`) is a Node.js CLI tool that syncs dotfiles and app configs across Macs via iCloud Drive. It moves config files into iCloud Drive and creates symlinks at their original locations so apps still find them.

## Commands

```bash
npm install              # Install dependencies
npm test                 # Run all tests
node --test test/add.test.js   # Run a single test file
```

No build step — ES modules run directly. Entry point: `bin/ianchor.js`.

## Architecture

**CLI layer** (`bin/ianchor.js`): Uses `commander` to parse commands, each dispatching to a function in `lib/`.

**Core modules** (`lib/`):
- `icloud.js` — Detects iCloud Drive path (`~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/`)
- `db.js` — SQLite wrapper (via `better-sqlite3`) managing the `entries` table
- `init.js` — Creates config directory in iCloud, opens DB, discovers existing files
- `add.js` — Moves file/dir to iCloud, creates symlink, records in DB
- `recover.js` — Moves file back from iCloud to original location
- `relink.js` — Re-creates broken symlinks for tracked entries
- `remove.js` — Deletes iCloud copy and DB record
- `list.js` — Shows tracked entries with live status (linked/unlinked/missing)
- `known-configs.js` — Maps common config filenames to their expected home paths

**Data flow**: CLI parses args → command handler calls `lib/` function → function reads/writes filesystem + SQLite DB → result printed to stdout.

**Database**: Single SQLite file (`ianchor.db`) stored inside the iCloud config directory. One table `entries` with columns: `id`, `name` (unique), `original_path`, `type` (file/directory), `status` (linked/unlinked/deleted), `created_at`, `updated_at`.

## Testing

Tests use Node.js built-in `node:test` module with `node:assert/strict`. Each `lib/` module has a corresponding `test/*.test.js` file. Tests create temp directories for isolation and clean up after themselves.

## Key Conventions

- ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- Node.js >=18.0.0 required
- Dependencies: `better-sqlite3`, `chalk`, `cli-table3`, `commander`
- Distribution via Homebrew (`Formula/ianchor.rb`); release script at `scripts/release.sh`
